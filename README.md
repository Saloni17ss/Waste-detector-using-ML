# Waste-detector-using-ML
 Design a system to monitor waste levels in bins using sensors, with automatic alerts sent for collection when the bin is full. Key Components: Microcontroller, Ultrasonic sensors for distance measurement, GSM or Wi-Fi module for communication. Research Potential: IoT-based city-wide waste management, data-driven decision-making for waste detector
